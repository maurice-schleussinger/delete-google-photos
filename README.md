# delete-google-photos
Delete all your Google Photos automatically.
This is a quick-and-dirty Python 3 script which tries its best to delete all your Google Photos automatically.

**Update:** As of now (17. Feb 2020 - 17:09:01) this script won't work at all, unless you manage to find an WebDriver which is able to log into an Google account.  Apparently, Google decided to block the login from automated Browsers (I tried chrome and gecko).


## Requirements

* Firefox (or another browser supported by Selenium)
* Selenium
* Selenium Python bindings. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

* Adjust config.py with your Google account credentials
* run `python3 delete_google_photos.py`
* wait and refresh the browser window if stuck (I knowâ€¦)

This script never finishes, so you have to check for yourself if there are still photos left to delete.
